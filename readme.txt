This code is for the article 'Multi-modal graph neural network for early diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s
disease from sMRI and PET scans', https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107328.

Feature file is code for constructing the individual brain matrix and the feature extraction, GNN file is the code for the multi-modal GNN framework. 

The dataset we didn't attached, need to extract ROI features from brain image yourself using spm12 and cat.
