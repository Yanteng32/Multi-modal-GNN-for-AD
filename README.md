# Multi-modal-GNN-for-AD

This code is for the article 'Multi-modal graph neural network for early diagnosis of Alzheimerâ€™s
disease from sMRI and PET scans', https://doi.org/10.1016/j.compbiomed.2023.107328.

Feature file is the code for constructing the individual brain matrix and the feature extraction (xfeatvol2.py), GNN file is the code for the multi-modal GNN framework (main_adj_dot_prod_ok1.py). 

The dataset didn't attach, need to extract ROI features from the brain image yourself using spm12 and cat.
